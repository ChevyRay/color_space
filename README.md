# UPDATE

This crate is no longer supported, nor recommended for use. If you want a
great crate for color management and conversations, I recommend checking
out the [palette](https://crates.io/crates/palette) crate!

https://crates.io/crates/palette

It achieves what this crate set out to do, has all the same features and
more, but does so with a much nicer, more flexible codebase.
